# Visitor Face Recognition System using DeepFace

This is a Python-based face recognition system that:
- Detects if a visitor is **new or returning**.
- Stores visitor details and face images.
- Uses the **DeepFace** library for verification.

---

## Features

- Captures and stores 3 face images of each visitor.
- Detects if a visitor has visited before using facial recognition.
- Stores visitor information like name, contact, and visit purpose.
- Uses a webcam for real-time image capture.
- Saves data persistently using pickle.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install deepface opencv-python
```

Also, make sure your system has a webcam.

---

## üìÅ Files

- main.py ‚Üí The core face recognition script (your script above).
- v.dat ‚Üí Binary file that stores visitor info and image filenames.
- Visitor.png, f<id><num>.png ‚Üí Visitor face images.

---

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. **Training a New Visitor**
If a visitor is not found in the database:
- You will be prompted to enter their details (name, number, purpose).
- 3 face images will be captured (f<id>4.png, f<id>5.png, f<id>6.png).
- Their data is saved in v.dat.

### 2. **Recognition**
- The webcam captures a real-time image (`Visitor.png`).
- Compares it with stored face images using DeepFace.
- If a match is found (based on distance < 0.1), it prints the previous visit info.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

It will:
- Start recognition.
- If no match is found, begin new visitor registration.
- Ask if there are more visitors (`Y/N`) and repeat if yes.

---

## Notes

- Ensure your face is clearly visible during capture.
- You can adjust the `distance` threshold for more/less strict matching.
- All visitor data is stored in a binary format (`pickle`), which can be modified later if needed.
